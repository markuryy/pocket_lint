# pocket lint (v1)

A tiny **low-interaction novelty terminal (L.I.N.T.)** you can 3D print. It's an ESP32 with a screen that fits in your pocket.

_To do what with? 🤷‍♀️_

## Bill of Materials

You will need a few off‑the‑shelf components and the 3D printed case.

## Example Projects

### Arduino

Here are some of the things I've done with the lil guy so far using Arduino:

- **[Power Test](/arduino_projects/power_test/readme.md):** Use the single button to turn the device on/off.
- **[Googly Eyes](/arduino_projects/googly_eyes/readme.md):** A pair of animated googly eyes whose pupils follow gravity and react to gentle tilting.

### ESP‑IDF

_I have no clue how this works._
